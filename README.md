# Web Starter Kit

This project has been setup to use a virtual machine for local development to closely mirror the production environment. To use the the virtual machine, follow these instructions.

## Preparing your local environment

  * Latest Virtualbox -- [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
  * Latest Virtualbox Extension Pack -- [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads]. Should match your Virtualbox version
  * Vagrant (currently tested with 1.7 and 1.8) -- [http://downloads.vagrantup.com](http://downloads.vagrantup.com)


## Getting Vagrant environment set up
Starting from within the root of your project (an existing project which already has a vagrant/puppet configured or starting a new project from the Drupal Starter Project), do the following:

1. Create VM by running "vagrant up" (This step will take long (might be 5+ minutes) as all necessary components are being downloaded and installed)
  * If you get an error re-provision the VM by running "vagrant provision" to see if this resolves the issue
2. SSH into VM by running "vagrant ssh"
3. Navigate to VM docroot by running "cd /vagrant/public"
4. Install Drupal using custom install profile by running "drush si [profile] -y" and following prompts. Alterntatively, use drush aliases to synch to a development instance of a site database. 

## Troubleshooting

Occasionally some issues may occur that prevent you from loading the virtual machine. Below are some common issues that others have experienced.

### General

If the virtual machine does not boot up and you get a message saying there was a timeout, try launching the VM through the Virtualbox interface to get more detailed information.


### Macintosh machines

* If you experience errors when sharing the folder over NFS you may need to enable File Sharing in System Preferences -> Sharing
* If you receive an error about an invalid export you may need to manually delete /etc/exports file
* If you've updated to Mavericks and Virtualbox is no longer working, try the following command: sudo /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart
* If you are prompted to enter your password when SSHing from the VM ensure your SSH private key is in the keychain by running "ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa" from your machine

### Linux machines

* If you experience errors when sharing the folder over NFS you may need to install the appropriate NFS packages, on Ubuntu you will need to run "sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server"

### Windows machines

* Virtualbox requires the Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) be enabled, if you receive a message saying that the VM requires a 64 bit processor and you only have an i686 processor this may be the cause
* Virtualbox may trigger a Windows Firewall popup to allow ports to be shared
* If the provisioning fails with errors on ports.conf or sites.xml this may be due to CRLF issues with the configuration files, to resolve this take the following actions:
  1. git config --global --edit
  2. Add line if missing: [core]
  3. Below that line add line: autocrlf = input
* if your ssh key information does not correctly forward, you can copy your ssh private key to ~/.ssh and chmod it 700
* if git says everything is changed, it's probably the line endings issues you've most likely seen before, doing "git add -u" should just remove them from the list (and not add them to be committed)


## Drush Alias File

A sample Drush alias file has been included at /examples/drupal/site.aliases.drushrc.php . Simply copy this file into public/sites/all/drush and modify the hostnames inside it. You will be able to access the vagrant environment with 'drush @site.local', dev with 'drush @site.dev', etc. 


# Composer template for Drupal projects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drupal-composer/drupal-project.svg?branch=8.x)](https://travis-ci.org/drupal-composer/drupal-project)

This project template provides a starter kit for managing your site
dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

If you want to know how to use it as replacement for
[Drush Make](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/8.x/docs/make.md) visit
the [Documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/2471553).

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) 
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev some-dir --stability dev --no-interaction
```

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your 
installation.

```
cd some-dir
composer require drupal/devel:~1.0
```

The `composer create-project` command passes ownership of all files to the 
project that is created. You should create a new git repository, and commit 
all files not excluded by the .gitignore file.

## What does the template do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal will be installed in the `web`-directory.
* Autoloader is implemented to use the generated composer autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`,
  instead of the one provided by Drupal (`web/vendor/autoload.php`).
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`) will be placed in `web/modules/contrib/`
* Theme (packages of type `drupal-theme`) will be placed in `web/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) will be placed in `web/profiles/contrib/`
* Creates default writable versions of `settings.php` and `services.yml`.
* Creates `web/sites/default/files`-directory.
* Latest version of drush is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drush`.
* Latest version of DrupalConsole is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drupal`.
* Creates environment variables based on your .env file. See [.env.example](.env.example).

## Updating Drupal Core

This project will attempt to keep all of your Drupal Core files up-to-date; the 
project [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) 
is used to ensure that your scaffold files are updated every time drupal/core is 
updated. If you customize any of the "scaffolding" files (commonly .htaccess), 
you may need to merge conflicts if any of your modified files are updated in a 
new release of Drupal core.

Follow the steps below to update your core files.

1. Run `composer update drupal/core webflo/drupal-core-require-dev symfony/* --with-dependencies` to update Drupal Core and its dependencies.
1. Run `git diff` to determine if any of the scaffolding files have changed. 
   Review the files for any changes and restore any customizations to 
  `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`.
1. Commit everything all together in a single commit, so `web` will remain in
   sync with the `core` when checking out branches or running `git bisect`.
1. In the event that there are non-trivial conflicts in step 2, you may wish 
   to perform these steps on a branch, and use `git merge` to combine the 
   updated core files with your customized files. This facilitates the use 
   of a [three-way merge tool such as kdiff3](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/12/how-to-setup-kdiff-as-diff-tool-for-git.html). This setup is not necessary if your changes are simple; 
   keeping all of your modifications at the beginning or end of the file is a 
   good strategy to keep merges easy.

## Generate composer.json from existing project

With using [the "Composer Generate" drush extension](https://www.drupal.org/project/composer_generate)
you can now generate a basic `composer.json` file from an existing project. Note
that the generated `composer.json` might differ from this project's file.


## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download?

Composer recommends **no**. They provide [argumentation against but also 
workrounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### Should I commit the scaffolding files?

The [drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) plugin can download the scaffold files (like
index.php, update.php, â€¦) to the web/ directory of your project. If you have not customized those files you could choose
to not check them into your version control system (e.g. git). If that is the case for your project it might be
convenient to automatically run the drupal-scaffold plugin after every install or update of your project. You can
achieve that by registering `@composer drupal:scaffold` as post-install and post-update command in your composer.json:

```json
"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "@composer drupal:scaffold",
        "..."
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@composer drupal:scaffold",
        "..."
    ]
},
```
### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull 
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the 
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra 
section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
        }
    }
}
```
### How do I switch from packagist.drupal-composer.org to packages.drupal.org?

Follow the instructions in the [documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-packagesdrupalorg).

### How do I specify a PHP version ?

Currently Drupal 8 supports PHP 5.5.9 as minimum version (see [Drupal 8 PHP requirements](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/system-requirements/drupal-8-php-requirements)), however it's possible that a `composer update` will upgrade some package that will then require PHP 7+.

To prevent this you can add this code to specify the PHP version you want to use in the `config` section of `composer.json`:
```json
"require": {
â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚â€‚"php": "^5.6||^7.0",
```
